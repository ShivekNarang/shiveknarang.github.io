        <!DOCTYPE html>          
  
        <p>I'm a senior at the <a href="https://www.upenn.edu" target="_blank">University of Pennsylvania</a>, pursuing an accelerated Master’s in bioengineering alongside a double major in neuroscience and cognitive science, with minors in healthcare management, data science, and chemistry. <br> 
          My academic and professional interests sit at the intersection of neuroscience, bioengineering, global health, and genetics, with a focus on advancing health equity through innovative and community-based approaches. <br> 

My experiences span a range of global health efforts—from analyzing brain connectivity in traumatic brain injury (TBI) at the <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/cnt/" target="_blank">Center for Neuroengineering and Therapeutics (CNT)</a> , to improving care accessibility in rural India at the <a href="https://aravind.org/" target="_blank">Aravind Eye Care System</a>, and supporting biomarker discovery through EEG-TMS neuroimaging research. <br>

I lead <a href="https://empowerthroughrecovery.org" target="_blank"> Empowerment Through Recovery</a>, a peer support program for TBI survivors, and founded Our Teen Brains, a nonprofit that equips adolescents with tools to navigate mental health challenges. Through GreenTeamPower, I also engage with communities affected by climate change, particularly in low-resource settings. <br>

At the heart of my work is a commitment to serving communities—especially those historically underrepresented or underserved in healthcare. Whether through education, advocacy, research, or innovation, I aim to support programs and initiatives that make meaningful, culturally relevant impact. <br>

        analysis</a> of the evolutionary relationships among baboon species (Papio genus) 
        by leveraging advanced bioinformatics tools and computational techniques. Using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data, 
        I constructed phylogenetic trees, calculated pairwise genetic distances, and assessed evolutionary rates to uncover 
        maternal lineage relationships and divergence patterns. This research utilized technologies such as NCBI GenBank 
        for sequence retrieval, MAFFT for multiple sequence alignment, and MEGA11 for phylogenetic 
        tree construction and evolutionary distance calculations. Python, combined with the pandas library, 
        was employed to extract and analyze branch lengths from phylogenetic tree data.
        
      
        <p><b>GlucaLink: Digital Health Solution for Prenatal Diabetes Management</b><br>
        I co-developed <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vLh_c45MhvOnqPMs8mdNp1h3_S2_y-lS/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        GlucaLink</a>, a digital health platform designed to optimize diabetes management during pregnancy by 
        consolidating remote glucose monitoring, reducing provider burden, and improving maternal and neonatal outcomes. 
        The system integrates real-time alerts, predictive analytics, patient-specific reminders, and an accessible, 
        user-friendly interface. We used Python for automation, Figma for interface design, and machine learning for predictive care. 
        GlucaLink addresses gaps in current care by reducing manual errors, enhancing user experience, and supporting scalability 
        for broader adoption in prenatal care.
       
        <p><b>Yelp Reviews in Healthcare: Sentiment Analysis and Predictive Modeling of Quality Ratings</b><br>
        This <a href="https://medium.com/@mrshiveknarang/choosing-where-to-seek-health-care-is-a-significant-decision-for-patients-and-is-dependent-on-many-974aaa79b1d7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        research</a> explores the use of Yelp reviews to analyze a large dataset on healthcare institutions, focusing on sentiment analysis and predictive modeling of star 
        ratings. It emphasizes the importance of patient-centric care and the challenges in quantifying healthcare quality. 
        The paper discusses the correlation between Yelp reviews and healthcare quality, addressing the need for reliable and patient-focused tools in healthcare evaluation.</p>

        <p><b>Stage Synthesis of 1-BROMO-3-CHLORO-5-IODOBENZENE from Aniline</b><br>
        This <a href="https://medium.com/@mrshiveknarang/6-stage-synthesis-of-1-bromo-3-chloro-5-iodobenzene-from-aniline-53ae188f14a6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 
        paper</a> outlines a six-stage synthesis reaction for the conversion of aniline into 1-bromo-3-chloro-5-iodobenzene. The process 
        involves acetylation to protect the amine group, followed by bromination and chlorination in successive steps. Hydrolysis is then 
        employed to remove the protecting group, and iodination is carried out, concluding with deamination to eliminate the amine. Electrophilic 
        aromatic substitution (EAS) with ortho, para, and meta directing groups directs the addition of various halogen groups. The products are 
        extracted through recrystallization and vacuum filtration. Purity is ensured through melting point, 1HNMR, and IR spectra analyses at 
        each stage, resulting in an overall synthesis yield of 8.09%.</p>

        <p><b>Big Data Analytics-Machine Learning Model to classify Credit card Fraud</b><br>
         Credit card scams and fraudulent transactions is an increasingly relevant issue with credit card companies 
         facing pressure to identify them and protect their customers. In this analysis, we build a 
         predictive model to use a set of chosen characteristics to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate. 
         We employed a variety of machine learning based approaches, carefully analyzing the benefits and drawbacks 
         of each before coming to a final model.
