      <section>

        <p>I am currently a third-year student at the <a href="https://www.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a>, 
          where I am pursuing a Master's in Bioengineering. My academic focus includes a double major in Neuroscience 
          and Cognitive Science, complemented by minors in Healthcare Management, Data Science, and Chemistry. 
          My academic journey reflects my commitment to advancing medical and neuroscience research, 
          as well as my dedication to understanding the intricate relationship between medicine and health care policy and management.
          
        <p>As an Undergraduate Researcher at the <a href="https://cnt.upenn.edu/">enter for Neuroengineering and Therapeutics</a>, I actively contribute to cutting-edge 
          research, honing skills in areas such as image segmentation, deep learning, and medical imaging. 
          Currently, my research is centered around comprehending the impact of traumatic brain injuries (TBI) 
          on epilepsy development through the innovative approach of functional connectivity mapping.

          <p> My research experience spans various laboratories, including Halpern Labs at the 
            <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu ">Perelman School of Medicine</a>  , 
          where I researched on identifying a biomarker differentiating reward responses. 
             At <a href="https://cherrylab.stanford.edu ">Cherry Labs, Stanford School of Medicine </a>  ,
          I collaboraated to developed a measure assessing the importance of genomic positions. Furthermore, 
          I have collaborated on projects related to MR-guided focused ultrasound for epilepsy treatment 
          and machine learning applications in neuroimaging.

<p> In addition to my academic pursuits, I am the President
          at <a href="https://www.ourteenbrains.com/">OurTeenBrains</a> a non-profit organization committed to 
          raising awareness about the developing teenage brain and adolescent mental health. 
          In this role, I lead initiatives to support teenagers during this transformative period, 
          organizing educational sessions, facilitating presentations, and offering assistance to over 4,000 teens 
          dealing with diverse challenges.

        . Book a free adolescent brain workshop with me!

<p> Recognizing the profound impact of climate change on global public health, 
          I am deeply committed to understanding its far-reaching health implications and their correlation with 
          overall well-being. Teaming up with diverse organizations, our collective efforts at 
  <a href="https://www.GreenTeamPower.org/">GreenTeamPower</a>  are dedicated to tackling the unequal
  health burdens faced by vulnerable populations, 
  particularly those in low-income countries. Together, we aim to make a meaningful impact on global public health, 
  striving for positive change and equitable solutions to address health disparities. 

<p> I lead impactful initiatives in my community, volunteering at local food banks to combat food
  insecurity and spearheading fundraising efforts. 
  
 <p> At <a href="https://www.NutritionNow.org/">NutritionNow</a>, We champion awareness about the detrimental effects and dangers of malnutrition
  in our communities, underscoring the critical role nutrition plays in overall well-being. 
   
  My commitment to leadership extends to advocating for positive change and fostering a healthier, more resilient community.
