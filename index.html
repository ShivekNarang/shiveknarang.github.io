      <section>

        <p>I am currently a third-year undergraduate student at the <a href="https://www.upenn.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Pennsylvania</a>, 
          where I am pursuing an acclerated Master's in Bioengineering. My academic focus includes a double major in Neuroscience 
          and Cognitive Science, complemented by minors in Healthcare Management, Data Science, and Chemistry. 
          My academic journey reflects my commitment to advancing medical and neuroscience research, 
          as well as my dedication to understanding the intricate relationship between medicine and health care policy and management.</p>
          
        <p>At the <a href="https://cnt.upenn.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Center for Neuroengineering and Therapeutics</a>, my current research focuses on understanding the impact of traumatic brain injuries (TBI) on epilepsy development. Employing functional connectivity mapping, my areas of specialization encompass image segmentation, deep learning, and medical imaging.</p>

        

<p> In addition to my academic pursuits, I am the President
          at <a href="https://www.ourteenbrains.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OurTeenBrains</a> a non-profit organization committed to 
          raising awareness about the developing teenage brain and adolescent mental health. 
          In this role, I lead initiatives to support teenagers during this transformative period, 
          organizing educational sessions, facilitating presentations, and offering assistance to over 4,000 teens 
          dealing with diverse challenges.</p>

<p> Recognizing the profound impact of climate change on global public health, I am deeply committed to understanding its far-reaching health implications and their correlation with overall well-being. Teaming up with diverse organizations, our collective efforts at
  <a href="https://www.GreenTeamPower.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GreenTeamPower</a> are dedicated to addressing the unequal health burdens faced by vulnerable populations, particularly those in low-income countries. </p>

        research</a> explores the use of Yelp reviews to analyze a large dataset on healthcare institutions, focusing on sentiment analysis and predictive modeling of star 
        ratings. It emphasizes the importance of patient-centric care and the challenges in quantifying healthcare quality. 
        The paper discusses the correlation between Yelp reviews and healthcare quality, addressing the need for reliable and patient-focused tools in healthcare evaluation.</p>

        <p><b>Stage Synthesis of 1-BROMO-3-CHLORO-5-IODOBENZENE from Aniline</b><br>
        This <a href="https://medium.com/@mrshiveknarang/6-stage-synthesis-of-1-bromo-3-chloro-5-iodobenzene-from-aniline-53ae188f14a6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 
        paper</a> outlines a six-stage synthesis reaction for the conversion of aniline into 1-bromo-3-chloro-5-iodobenzene. The process 
        involves acetylation to protect the amine group, followed by bromination and chlorination in successive steps. Hydrolysis is then 
        employed to remove the protecting group, and iodination is carried out, concluding with deamination to eliminate the amine. Electrophilic 
        aromatic substitution (EAS) with ortho, para, and meta directing groups directs the addition of various halogen groups. The products are 
        extracted through recrystallization and vacuum filtration. Purity is ensured through melting point, 1HNMR, and IR spectra analyses at 
        each stage, resulting in an overall synthesis yield of 8.09%.</p>
